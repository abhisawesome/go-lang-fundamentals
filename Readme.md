Fundamentals:

    Basics:
        Write a Go program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.
        Declare variables of different types (int, float64, string, bool) and print their values.
        Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on these variables and print the results.
        Use comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) and control flow statements (if, else, switch) to make decisions.
        Create simple loops (for, while) to iterate over a range of values or repeat a block of code.
    Functions:
        Define a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum, difference, product, or quotient.
        Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd.
        Create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
        Experiment with passing values by reference using pointers.
    Data Structures:
        Initialize and use arrays and slices to store collections of values.
        Access and modify elements in arrays and slices using indexing and slicing.
        Create maps to store key-value pairs and retrieve values using keys.
        Define custom structs to combine data of different types and access their members.

Intermediate:

    Strings:
        Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the occurrences of each unique character.
        Reverse a string in-place without creating a new one.
        Implement a function to check if a string is a palindrome.
    Concurrency:
        Create goroutines to perform tasks concurrently (e.g., printing numbers sequentially while calculating the factorial).
        Use channels to communicate and synchronize data between goroutines.
        Explore waitgroups to ensure all goroutines have finished before exiting the program.
    Files and I/O:
        Write a program that reads text from a file and prints it line by line.
        Create a new file and write data to it.
        Implement error handling to gracefully handle potential issues during file operations.
    Error Handling:
        Understand different types of errors in Go (e.g., syntax errors, runtime errors).
        Use the error interface to handle errors with if statements or deferred functions.
        Consider returning errors from functions and propagating them up the call stack.

Advanced:

    Testing:
        Write unit tests for your functions to ensure they work as expected.
        Use tools like go test or a testing framework to run and organize your tests.
    Packages and Modules:
        Organize your code into reusable packages.
        Manage dependencies using modules and go mod commands.
    Network Programming:
        Create a simple HTTP server that responds to requests.
        Use libraries like net/http to make HTTP requests and process responses.
    Reflection:
        Explore the reflect package to inspect types and values at runtime.
        Experiment with dynamic function calls and data manipulation.
